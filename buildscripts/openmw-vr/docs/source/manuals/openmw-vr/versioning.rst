Versions and Releases
#####################
OpenMW-VR does not have its own versioning. OpenMW-VR does however base itself on builds of OpenMW. Currently this is
an arbitrarily chosen nightly build of OpenMW 0.47.

Release Schedule
****************
Currently OpenMW-VR does not have anything like a release schedule or official version numbers. New builds happen
whenever I find the time to do some coding. This is because the intent is to merge with OpenMW and make VR an official,
optional feature of OpenMW, not to maintain a separate project.

Merge Timeline: 0.48
********************
Currently, the intent is to merge OpenMW-VR by 0.48. But this is not a promise.
